I am currently a quantitative researcher at JPMorgan Asset Management. I enjoy learning and conducting machine learning research during my free time. I am fortunate to have been mentored by [Prof. Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io/). I obtained my master's from [Columbia University](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/) and bachelor's from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Hongning Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qkdvKNoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Research Interests

My research focus is primarily on financial application of machine learning algorithms in natural langauge processing and more recently multimodal LLMs. Specifically, I am interested in **continual learning, few shot learning, and explainable algorithms**.
<!--My research focus is primarily on financial forecasting.-->
