I am currently a ML quantitative researcher at JPMorgan Asset Management and a part-time Master's student in the Computer Science department at Columbia University. I enjoy learning and conducting AI research during my free time. I am fortunate to have been mentored by [Prof. Jundong Li](http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~jl6qk/). Prior to my current position, I obtained my bachelor's from [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) (UVa), where I worked with [Prof. Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/).

Research Interests

My research focus is primarily on graph machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in **fair and robust graph learning, dynamic graph learning, and few shot learning on graphs**.
